https://sidequestvr.com/app/38028/metal-hellsinger-vr,"Welcome everyone to my Metal: Hellsinger review! I hope that you're here for the badass music, because we'll have plenty here! I've been eyeing this game since the first official trailer back at the IGN Game Showcase of 2020. And let me tell you, watching a trailer like this for the first time was quite amazing. We've never seen so many gathered legends making a soundtrack like this for a video game. The flatscreen version was well received, but did the developers do a good job at translating this game to VR? This is always a hit or miss, so lets find out together!

Metal: Hellsinger was released on September 26th, 2024 on Meta Quest and is compatible with the Quest 2, Pro, 3 and 3S and the developers of this version of the game are Lab42 and The Outsiders.

Gameplay

The best way to describe this game is as if Doom 2016 and Rockband would've been put in a blender, and spit out a game. You get the aesthetics and gameplay of Doom, but the interesting thing is that every shot you take have to follow the beat of the song that's playing in the level. When you need to reload your weapon, you also need to do a gesture to the beat for a quick reload. And you also have a special for each weapon that you can activate when your meter is full.

As you manage to follow the beat, your damage will increase, and you get a multiplier that goes up to 16 times your score. When you reach that score streak, vocals will kick in the song, and let me tell you, when that happens, it's sooo satisfying! You really try to keep that streak because it's just so much better with the lyrics, but they make you work really hard for those vocals.

The game is divided into levels, and at the end of each level, you will encounter a boss that you have to defeat. This part can be a little disappointing since every single boss except the last one is kind of the same enemy, but with different patterns. So it doesn't feel too exciting just defeating him over and over.

Story / Graphics

You know, when you port a flatscreen game to VR, I bet that it's kind of hard to figure out how to deliver cutscenes in an interesting way, and I find that they did a pretty decent job here. The animated cutscenes are delivered through your cave hub and you can just watch them through the usual portal that you go through. And then the 3D cutscenes are delivered in 3rd person while you watch the protagonist entering the domain. I enjoyed that and did not affect my immersion.

The story is about a demon called The Unknown who got her voice stollen by the judge. They then sealed her somewhere with no way to escape, until one day she did, with her only mission being to recover her voice as the hellsinger. Very single, but it works! You're not here to listen to a full fledge story after all, you're here to kick ass and kill demons, so it doesn't get in the way.

The graphics are kind of hit or mis. The color pallets works very well in the headset, but because the game is compatible with the Quest 2, I feel like the Quest 3 is taking a hit. This is not something that you can see here, but the resolution is also not the best. I'm not saying that it's bad. It's amazing what they were able to port here, but I just know that the Quest 3 can do better and I personally can't wait when developers decide to prioritize the Quest 3. This game would've looked amazing.

Music

Ok guys so we all know what REALLY attracted us to this game in the first place. It's the the amount of legends that they've gathered to make this crazy soundtrack! The music is a collection of heavy metal artists, and I might massacre some of the names, but we get Mikael Stanne from Dark Tranquility, Matt Heafy from Trivium, Randy Blythe from Lamb of God, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, and many more! Getting a full collection of songs from these artists is just insane. I'm going to tell you something, nobody in their right mind would critique the soundtrack of this game unless you don't like heavy metal, because I have to say that it's one of the best original video game composition of heavy metal songs. Music is one of the biggest aspect of what makes a game fun for me personally, so this cranked my enjoyment to overdrive.

Difficulties / Other Features

There are 4 difficulties in the game: Lamb, Goat, Beast and Archdevil. I went with beast mode since Archdevil is locked up until you beat the game once. The balance of beast was great. I didn't die too much, but that's good, because when you die in this mode, you actually have to completely redo the level. So let me tell you that I was really trying hard not to die haha. The difficulties affect your health, the enemies health, and how much off beat you can be to have the perfect score. Sadly, I couldn't defeat the last boss on that difficulty and for the sake of not taking too much time to make the review, I had to tone it down one level, but I know that I could complete it with more time.

What's cool after you unlock Archdevil difficulty and try it, the enemy placement is different. You'll actually have an assortment of enemies from the last level inside the first level, and they even introduce new enemies! So they did a really good job with that difficulty, and makes the game worth replaying a few times. It took me around 4 and a half hours to complete, but I could see people take less time than that. I just took the time to enjoy every single minute of it.

Every level also has 3 challenges that you can complete to obtain sigils. You are allowed to equip 2 sigils at a time, and these gives you a nice type of buff that give you some advantage. Like your scorestreak not getting affected when you get hit once, and things like that. These sigils are almost needed to complete the Archdevil difficulty, which makes sense to why it's only unlocked after you finish the game. I'd probably go ahead and get all of the sigils before even trying to complete it that way.

Bugs

So sadly, there are some annoyance and frustrations in the game. The first thing is that the sword reeeeally sucks. No matter how much I tried to swing it to the beat, it never really works. I'm not sure why, but it just never works well, it's like it never hit the enemy right on the beat, when I'm sure that it does.

The second thing is that I've encountered a few glitched areas where it's just missing some or all of the assets. This one time I just needed to wait for all enemies to fall to their death and then move on to the next level.

The last thing, and oh my gosh this one is annoying. Sometimes you press the finishing move to gain some health, but it just doesn't trigger. I mean, look at this part where you see my sword switching for the finishing move, and it does nothing. Man this part really frustrated me since I was at the boss, and died because of it. This may only be an issue in Archdevil mode since I didn't notice it happening before, but this is the hardest difficulty, this is where you'd want it to work.

Alright guys, even though there were some frustrations, I can forgive them because otherwise I had an amazing time with the game, and it wouldn't surprise me if I'd jump back to it at some point to play some more. The nice thing is that these issues are fixable, so I'm hoping the that the devs are actively looking into these issues to make the game perfect. Don't let these discourage you, this game is super fun and I recommend it if you want a fun heavy metal adventure in VR."
https://sidequestvr.com/app/38028/metal-hellsinger-vr,This game is a mixture of Doom and Beat Saber mashed into a rogue like shooter. It really does take some time to get used to the combat in this game as it really wants you to deal damage to the heavy metal beats that are playing in the background. The environments are beautiful although i will say it takes a big hit graphically compared to the PCVR version. Voice acting is perfect and the music really make this game heavy metal themed to its core. The combat however really seems to take a bit to get used to and really feels like its just something thrown in there for fun. I really think this game would be alot better without the added rhythm to it being so involved as it made me feel bound from dealing as much damage as i want and instead having to worry about hitting musical notes. Its not a terrible game but it does not play how one would think from the trailers.

This game was so fun to play with my friend, we played until our headsets died. It’s all about teamwork but also very unserious. Try it, you have nothing to lose!"
https://sidequestvr.com/app/38056/dimensional-double-shift,"Today we're doing a review of a game that was just announced called Dimensional Double Shift! When I was approached and asked if I could cover a new unannounced game by Owlchemy Labs, I was very curious to take a look. So guys grab your punch card, clock in, and let's start this review up!

Dimensional Double Shift is releasing this September 26th, 2024 and will be available for the low cost of zero dollar. You heard me right! This game will be free at launch. The game is compatible with the Quest 2, Pro and 3 and the developers of the game are Owlchemy Labs who are the famous creators of the well beloved Job Simulator and Vacation Simulator! Alright lets get this show on the road!

Gameplay / Restaurant

First and foremost, I want to give a massive thanks to Live Open Mike for helping me out and joining my session.

So Dimensional Double Shift is a game where you're thrown in a job where you have to work in co-op with up to 4 players to accomplish your tasks in the fastest and cleanest way. During the release, there are 2 types of jobs that you can do.

Your first job is being a cook at a restaurant. You have to make 8 orders in total together with your friends. Your workstation will be randomly generated, so every time that you play the game, you may have different ingredients and tools at your disposition.

This game has kind of an Overcook vibe, you first need to select an order from the rack on top and scan it in your section. You will then be presented with ingredients that you need to prepare and put on a plate or in a cup. When you're done, you hit the bell to tell that your order is ready, and then you move on to another order.

There are challenge orders that you can pick, and they don't tell you all of the ingredients that you need. For example, they could tell you that you need a pancake with any 3 ingredients in it. So you'll need to use your imagination and put maybe chocolate, blueberries and a banana, and then you're good to go!

When you're done with the 8 orders, you go in overtime, and you have a timer where you need to make as much orders as possible to have one last chance to increase your score, and then you're done!

Live Open Mike told me that he was a cook for more than 10 years, so he was able to transfer his skills pretty good in the game, and it really showed as he was definitely doing better than me. What's also cool is that sometimes the ingredients that you need are at your co-worker's station. So you have to communicate in order to be the most efficient.

Gameplay / Garage

The second game that you have is the garage, me and Live Open Mike confirmed that this was our favorite game from the 2.

Basically you have a car that you bring up, and you have all kinds of things that you have to fix in it. It's the same thing where everything seems randomly generated. And this one definitely requires more teamwork.

For example, we'll have some kind of device that we'll need to crank together, or there is this one time where I needed to pour oil in the car, but I had no idea how much I needed to poor, so Mike had to tell me when to stop.

In this game, you'll get 2 cars to repair before it ends, and yeah you just have a bunch of handy tools needed to make the car work, such as a machine that creates cogwheels for you. So you just have to dig around and figure out everything that's wrong with the car.

Features / Character Customization

Before anything else, when you start the game for the first time, you are inside a hub and a robot greets you to explain how the game mechanics work. Dimensional Double Shift is actually hand tracking only! So you'll need to put the controllers aside and just use your hands. To select anything, you just need to pinch with your fingers, and that is also how the keyboard works.

The game is co-op only, so you cannot start the game unless you have someone joining you. The way it works is very similar to Walkabout Minigolf or a lot of other games where you enter a password, and people can join you by putting the same word. It'd be nice if eventually you could get matched with random people, I could see that being very fun.

The last thing you can do in the initial hub is customize your character! You can select things such as your skin color, hair style and color, and then you can select accessories such as your wristband, a hat and visor's color. Enough things to differentiate your character from others. You also have a nametag that you can smash 2 names together to identify yourself.

Learning Curve / Progression

So something that I find cool with the game is that there's not really any tutorials. I like that you just have to figure out stuff with your co-worker. It was a fun experience, and when we tried the games for a second time, we could see ourselves improve since we started understanding more what we needed to do. So it's a really fun game to go in blind.

When you finish your tasks, you are then transported back to the hub with your friends, and you get points that will make you rank up. If you do rank up, then you unlock a new item that you can use to customize your character. Something interesting is that it seems to be randomly generated. Mike and I were never receiving the same items, even though we're in the same rank.

Speaking of the hub, you can also get transported to a campfire to shill out. You can use a stick and cook some sausages and marshmallow, and you can also do silly things like cook your can of pop, or burn your hands. And then there's the radio that you can turn on. The radio will have some music, or even silly things like a poet dictating his creation, and things like that.

So guys I hope that you enjoyed my review of Dimensional Double Shift. As you can see, you can have an infinite amount of playtime in this since situations in both games are randomly generated, and fun! The questions that I'm asking myself for the future of the game is will there be new games added later? If not, even though you could end up having fun for hours, the variety still seems a little barebone.

The second question that I have is will there be the possibility to purchase things in the game with in game currency, and what will they be exactly."

Duck, dive, and dodge your way though insane amounts of traffic as you ride your motorbike into the future. This game is super fun and also very challenging. The traffic patterns change constantly and really lets you test your reaction times by dodging the multiple things coming at you. The game lets you upgrade your motorbike with several different functions and really makes the bike yours. The story is really good and keeps you wanting to play which is always a plus too. Eventually not only do you dodge traffic but you have to shoot enemies out of the sky and its just keeps getting harder and harder. If your a fan of a challenge this one is for you!"

You are able to drop into the game with friends and basically tour this amusement park like you would in real life. There are several carnival games, food, and even rides to get on that make you feel like you are really there. You can run into people and compete at games which really adds a great layer to the game. There are also leaderboards and a massive hall of fame for the top players at each game. I am sure they will be adding more and more rides and games to the festival as it really shows what can be done with a game like this. The environment is so lively and quite impressive. The game is free so there is no reason not to try this game at all. If your into having fun with friends this is a must have game."

I do wish there were some kind of hint system and possibly even puzzle skipping, as I spent most of my time solving the slider puzzle, and was stuck on what to draw.

The game features beautiful visuals, engaging puzzles, and a delightful story. Players take on the role of Molly, a girl who finds herself in Wonderland for the first time. Molly must navigate through a series of interconnected dioramas, solving puzzles and interacting with various characters along the way.

https://sidequestvr.com/app/37493/stunt-double-joe-mcflash,"Today we're taking a look at Stunt Double Joe Mcflash! Now, I'm sure that it's the first time that a lot of you hear about this game, but I was lucky enough to try the alpha a few months ago, and I honestly couldn't wait to get my hands on the full release! So today I'm here to explain everything about the game, especially why it's so fun. So let's get this started! 

Stunt Double Joe Mcflash is coming out on September 2nd, 2024 in early access on the Meta store. It will be available for 15.99 Euros, and is compatible with the Meta Quest 2 and 3. The developer of the game is MoonShine Games. This is a single indie developer who made a handful of games, with Connor being his most popular one so far. I've made a review of this game in the past, so check it out if you're interested. Let's take a look at the game now. 

So the game is very easy to explain. You are a Stunt driver, and your job is to reach these checkpoints before the time runs out. But there's a lot of variety to it, which I'll explain later. You start the game by being in the audience of a late late show. This show is actually interviewing Joe Mcflash, who is the Stunt Double of many movies. During the interview, he basically talks about his experience in every movies that he worked on, and you're basically reliving his experience with him. 

Throughout the game, you'll be experiencing 5 movies, and every movie has a handful of scenes that you need to go through. The progression is great, because you're not allowed to skip any movie or scene. They unlock as you finish the next scene. You'll be going in movies such as:

The Lucky Man: This is a section where you'll be driving in a very busy city with narrow streets, parking buildings, and other bigger sections. 

In The Country Brothers, you'll be driving through farms, dirt road, and even have a police car and chase some vigilante. This movie is definitely an homage to The Dukes of Hazzard. 

In Tropical Blunder, you drive through tropical forests with some ancient buildings, but as you progress through this one, you end up in a volcanic section where you have to escape. 

Arctic Blast is pretty self explanatory. You drive in the snow, icy areas and storms where the visibility is reduced, but you have these red smoke signals to help you out. 

And then the last movie is This is the End. Which is most likely a tribute to Mad Max where you drive in deserted plains in a buggy while your obstacles are usually scrap cars and damaged buildings. 

What's cool is that each time that you finish a movie. You are then transported to a theater to see a trailer of the movie you've worked on. Kind of a rewarding little scene. In case you don't know how to get out of the theater, like I did, you just need to click the little poster on the upper right side. 

So the variety is not just the environment. Your main goal is to reach the checkpoints in a certain amount of time. You'll often get slow motion scenes when you jump, and put you on the camera that's filming that scene. It's pretty satisfying as it happens, and it never really feels old, some camera angles can be pretty epic. 

You also get different types of objectives which keeps it fresh. Some of the scene is a car chase, there's one scene where you're literally dodging icicles popping out of nowhere. And there's even a scene where you're kind of in a traffic jam, and have to make sure that you don't hit any cars. There's tons of other little things like this, which doesn't make it boring. 

I also love how the game becomes more and more challenging as you go. The first movie can be a little bit of a cake walk, but I'd say that the challenge starts ramping up starting the middle of the 3rd movie. Now I must admit that I'm not the best at car driving in video games, so it might be easier for others, depending on your skills. But I personally failed a lot of times, and it took me about 4 hours to finish the game. It never felt frustrating though, except for one part that I'll talk about later, but when I usually failed, I knew that it was my fault and needed to do something better. 

The game is not just about putting the pedal to the metal at full speed. You really have to think how you drive the car. You might need to slow down to do a narrow turn, or to avoid an obstacle. There's also icy terrain that you have to be very careful with. The cars in the game are very responsive and handles very well. When you use your brakes while turning, you'll do a very nice drift. So I can see so people doing some very nice time attack if they're good at drifting. 

The one level that really frustrated me was the last scene of Arctic Blast. There's a section where you really don't have a lot of time to get to, and then you have to cross a super narrow bridge. But you can't take your time or else you wont have time to make it to the next check point. I'm not gonna lie, I've cursed a lot in this level and it didn't feel fun at all after being stuck on it for a long time. Although, the good news is that I've contacted the developer, and he will be adding some additional seconds to these checkpoints. So it shouldn't be too bad on release. 

Speaking of which, I did have some nice conversations with the developer. He also mentioned that he's making some improvements on the game, like lighting effects for example. As soon as I finished the game, I asked him when are we getting a sequel? Haha. I'm serious, it's really fun. The reason for that is because it's so unique. I've never seen a game like that in VR, and different ideas like this is what I'm looking for. The dev also mentioned that more movies will come in the future for this game. So keep a lookout. 

So, you know, the game is not perfect. It's only made by one developer after all. So I do have to mention a few nitpicks that some people may not like, and here they are. A lot of AI stuff was used. Like the movie posters, the voice acting and the music. I'm personally ok with this due to the budget that the dev has to deal with. There's also a weird thing where your hands seems to decalibrate from the wheel sometimes. So I just have to ungrab and grab the wheel again to recalibrate. There's some voice acting at the start of the scene, but sometimes it gets cut off and the game starts before he's done. There are some frustrating jumps sometimes that really don't feel fair and inconsistent. The game doesn't let you restart the scene. You have to wait for the checkpoint to time out before you can. These are the biggest things that I've noticed, but there's also other little things. I'm happy to say thought that I have not encountered any breaking bugs in my playthrough. The core of the game was pretty smooth. 

Alright guys as you might've noticed, I really enjoyed my time with this one, of course it lacks the quality of a bigger budget title, but it's very fun, unique, with a lot of variety. If what you see today seems like a fun time, I don't think that you'll be disappointed."
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37493/stunt-double-joe-mcflash,This game is pretty fun. I'm terrible at driving games in VR but still enjoy playing them if the fun factor is there. This game definitely is fun yet challenging. The game features multiple movies with various scenes to play through and unlock. The graphics are very basic but doesn't take away from the fun factor of the game at all. Driving is simple just acceleration and break with steering but don't let that fool you it can be quite difficult especially when using hand break turns and jumps.

All the batman's gadgets are there along side an xp map that allows you to upgrade your batsuit, combat and gadgets. This is how VR should be, I've not felt this immersed in a game in a along time.

The music and atmosphere due to sound design puts you in the location. Imagine stepping inside your favourite arkham game and this is it. The combat flows well once you get used to it and how to throw your hands in which order or direction and when. The gadgets are amazing and you pull them from specific points in your armor. The same upgrade system from the arkham series exists here so be prepared to upgrade your gear. You can utilise your cape for gliding and stunning enemies which feels awesome. The grappling hook and the batterang are my favourite things to do in vr besides beat thugs to a pulp. Would definitely recommend this awesome game. The story looks to be on average around 12 hours depending on play style."

https://sidequestvr.com/app/38071/starship-home,This might just be the most immersive way to use mixed reality to date. In this game you get to turn your whole playspace into a mothership for the stars! You get to visit alien plants and suck up their resources and most importantly their plant species. It is really fun because it lets you collect plants that you must take care of and place around your play area in any way you wish. It has a great story mode thats not too hard and also not too long. I find that this game can be played by all ages and really shows off the growing concepts and technology mixed reality has to offer with the quest 3 passthrough. Some parts of the game can become very color intense and flashy so please be away of that if you do have medical conditions. Great way to show your friends a vr headset and cant wait to see what happens next for this game!

https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,I dont know if its just me but i really wasnt impressed with this game. The controls are not that easy to pick up even when you are using your hands. Theres not much to the game ist like old school misile command but i found myself missing all the rockets. The mixed reality is pretty cool with its old school green matrix look but maybe i was expecting a bit more from this.
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,"Man, as time goes on, we keep seeing some pretty unique ideas out there, and this one is no exception! So grab yourself a fanny pack full of quarters, and see if this arcade experience is a token muncher, or a walk in the park.

Airspace Defender is coming out today, October 18th on Meta Quest in Early Access and is compatible with the Quest 2, Pro, 3 and 3S. But I would recommend to play this one with the 3 family because this is a Mixed Reality title after all. The developers are Not Suspicious and I believe that this is their second title with the first one being a game called Tablecraft.

Gameplay

If you were a kid that grew up in the 80s, this game will remind you right away of Missile Command from the arcade and the Atari 2600. You are basically the commander of 2 turrets and your one and only goal is to prevent any missile from destroying your city.

If your middle headquarter is hit twice, then it's gameover and you have to start from the very beginning. The buildings that surrounds your HQ can be very useful to distract the missiles from hitting your main building, but it definitely gets harder when they get destroyed, so it's best to keep everything safe as long as possible.

You are presented with levels throughout your run. There's a timer for each one, and as soon as the countdown is done, you've finished the level! One other reason to keep your buildings is to gain a bigger score at the end of the level.

When the level is done, you are then presented with an important decision. You have 3 options to pick before proceeding. You can either install a new building that was destroyed, or you can select a new weapon to upgrade one of your turrets. I personally really like the machine gun and laser upgrade. They're the ones that made my run go the smoothest.

Tutorial

When you start the game, you have the ability to do a tutorial, and this is very useful to get introduced mostly on getting a hang of the controls. You also slowly get introduced to all enemy types that you'll be seeing during your regular runs.

The way the game works is kind of interesting, you need to use your hands to pinch at the location you want your missile to launch, and that's pretty much the only ability that you have. It's definitely not easy though! The 3D and 360 degree of the map makes it so you have to be very precise to where you're pinching. It's super easy to choke when you're in a pickle and that's what usually ends a run for me.

Currently, there are 2 modes in the game. Pretty much normal and hard mode. The difference between both is that in normal, you will get a lot less missiles when you start. On hard, you get more missile and more variety a lot quicker. Some of the missile types are super hard to hit, so I'm grateful to have some upgrades most of the time.

Future Updates / Feedback

So since the game is in early access, the developers have confirmed that we should expect a new game update every month starting in November. So it's kind of a good investment to buy the game now, and then follow along the developers and try new fresh content every month. Also, make sure to check out their Discord server to give feedback and help on improving the game.

Since this is a review I'd like to give a little bit of my feedback on things that I would like in hope that the developers are watching this.

So the game use handtracking only, and i've seen this on many games where the tracking can be lost, or not registered properly. It's not a perfect mechanic. It can be kind of frustrating when you're trying to be fast, and the command doesn't register, and it could be the one command that's a make or break for the situation. So I'd like to see the implementation of the controllers at some point. This would make it a lot more precise and make it more fair on my end.

I believe that there's only one song when you start the level. The song is really good, but when you play 1 or 2 hours, I'd like to see some more songs added in the mix.

Last thing that I've noticed is after playing more than one hour, the game became very janky and I had to reset it. I think that there's some memory that's not being dumped as you keep playing, so I would like the devs to investigate that.

Last Thoughts

Here's a few more things that I'd like to talk about the game. Yeah I know that it's a simple one, but when you enjoy a game, you just like to talk about it.

You have the ability to move the dome wherever you want. I like this feature since the original position was a little too low to my taste.

And I just love how the game looks! It's very simplistic, but the green and black pallet really makes it look like a game in the past. They really nailed the old school arcade aspect. Every time I failed, I kept going for one more, and another one, and another one. There is a public leaderboard available and I just wanted to keep trying to make it higher. The developers even noticed my score on the leaderboard, so that was kind of cool.

So guys this is what I had to say about Airspace Defender, a fun little game! Don't expect something super deep, but man you will get an addicting experience that you can bring on the go with your headset if you enjoy any type of Atari games from the past. It's cranks that feeling up to the max."
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37568/airspace-defender,This game is great! It reminds me of the old school arcade game and feels really great using the mixed reality color passthrough of the Quest 3. The added bonus of using your hand tracking really adds that extra level of fun to it too. I love the different types of missiles you can unlock and use to a strategic advantage. This game defiantly takes some time to master but once you do it really gets challenging. It seems to farther you get in the game the harder it gets! Even though this is only a demo alot is going on here and the devs have done a great job with it so far. I cant wait to see what is next for this game in the full version!

https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"This app exceeded my expectations. 

What I thought was a simple tracing app turned out to be a comprehensive drawing course. It teaches you the fundamental drawing skills like Form, Value, Lighting and so on using mixed reality. I really loved the fact that I could adjust the opacity of the layers so that I could still see what I was drawing.

There is also some 3D models included in the app, and you have the possibility to import your own images or models too. 

Pencil is great for beginners but is also nice for more advanced people. 

The mixed reality and hand-tracking was flawless. If you want to learn a new skill, this might be the one to try out!"
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"I LOVE THIS! Pencil XR does a great job utilizing the Meta Quest 3’s Mixed Reality. I love seeing MR being used for learning. I have never been good at drawing and have very poor handwriting in general. Pencil XR makes me happy to be living in this day & age where technology like this can be used to help people learn. I really enjoyed putting my hand to pencil, to paper, and actually creating something. Leo, the art teacher is so adorable and charming. I highly recommend this for all ages!"
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37685/pencil,"This is a must have game if you are into drawing or you want to learn to draw. The game really is unique when using the color passthrough for the quest 3 and in my opinion one of the best ways to use it. Incorporating learning with the quest is a major win on many levels and this game proves what can be done. You are able to choose from several different options based on your skill level and the game takes you step by step to learn how to create the drawling. After enough practice you can start to freehand based on the things you have learned. I can not draw worth a darn, so this game really helps you to build the confidence to create a masterpiece. Very unique and intuitive game that really is a creative way to use mixed reality. I hope they add more things to draw over tile as there is only a few to pick from at the moment. Great game and great for all ages!"

https://sidequestvr.com/app/38445/spinball-360-tennis,"Today I want to talk about my experience with this amazing Mixed Reality game that just came out. I had a blast with this one in the last couple of days and would like to make a deep dive into what it is, and what you get out of it. So take position, make your serve, and let the game begin! 

Spinball just released on Meta Quest on October 17th for $14.99USD and is compatible with the Quest 2, Pro, 3 and 3S. The developers are Blue Duck Studios. Who are known for their competitive game Gravity League. When they reached out to me, I was quite surprised that we were already getting a new game, since the previous one released just a few months ago. Well I was happy that I had a chance to try it so let's talk about it! 

What is Spinball? 

OK guys, imagine a sport that is only possible in VR, that's pretty much how this feels. You are trapped in a cage with your opponent with some kind of trampoline in the middle. All you need to do is make sure you hit the ball so it bounces in the middle circle, and then you opponent needs to do the same thing. It's simple on paper, but there's a lot of tricks to it. 

The first thing that you have to keep in mind is your opponent's position. It's really bad to stay face to face from them, because the ball will bounce towards you, and it can be pretty easy to get disoriented to where the ball is at.

You then also need to think when to hit the ball, the lower you hit it, the more more control you have towards it and make your opponent lose their chance to hit it. You have to be careful not to hit it too hard, because it can actually go out of the 4 walls and the opponent will get a point. The first who reaches 11 points wins the match.

As soon as you start the game, there is a tutorial that explains all of this to you, and you can put it into practice. 

Minigames

If you try a few matches and find that you lack practice, there are some minigames in there that are made to help you out. 

The first one is called Offense. This is a machine that will pop a ball at random locations at random speed. Your goal is to hit the pad when the ball is at its lowest possible. You will get a score out of 100 that will indicate how low you've hit it. You can set the difficulty of the machine from Newbie to Expert where Newbie will be very slow balls that are easy to hit, and Expert are extremely fast and low ball that requires a lot of effort and reflex to hit.

The second minigame is freestyle. Very easy to explain since all you do is hitting the ball however you like and practice your hits and coordination. This gave me a flashback to when I was a kid and wanted to practice my badminton reflexes, I used to play against a wall and try to smash the birdy as hard as possible. This is the best place to practice your skills with no string attached.

Next one is Ball Machine. It's kind of similar to Offense but it's not about hitting the ball to the lowest. You get a variety of options for the machine like the Shot Rate, the power, and spin of the shot. You can also select if you want the machine to move at different position, or make it move for each shot. Another thing different about this one is that if you keep hitting the ball, it'll stay in the ring. So if you're skilled enough, you can try to keep multiple balls going at the same time.

Last one available as of right now is Accuracy where you have to bounce the ball into the basketball hoop. You can decide how high you want to hoop to be, and how large you want the ring of the hoop. Each time you dunk it in, the hoop then changes position. You know, I play tennis once in a while, and something that I miss in this game is the kind of impact that the ball gives you. My brain is not used to not having that, so I've noticed that my accuracy was really bad by played this one, it's probably my biggest weakness and I have to practice some more.

According to the developer's discord, the Training Modes are still in progress, so it's very much possible that we'll get some more in the future.

Release/Future Content

Speaking of future content, for the release, we did get some additional features compared to the beta. The devs have informed me that we will have a personal AI voice trainer, improved physics and more. Now I'm curious about the physics, since it already feels pretty smooth, but I mean, keep the improvement coming for sure!

The Blue Duck are also very transparent in their roadmap. Make sure to join their discord to keep up to date, I'll put it in the description of the video so you can check it out, but let's talk about it here.

They will be adding a Monthly leaderboard that will included prices for the top 10 ranks. Oh by the way, you do get cosmetics in the game. In the beta, we were able to get 3 types of racquets, 3 balls, and 3 heads. They are labeled as Common, Rare and Epic. So looks like there will be some looting in there. I'm happy with that since it gives me a reason to keep playing and brag with my equipment.

We should also see a single player challenge mode with AI increasing levels as you progress, with more prices unlocking while doing it. There is currently a single player mode in the game with 6 difficulties in total. I'm currently trying to defeat the 4th difficulty, which is Extreme, and I'm definitely having a hard time!

Looks like there will be a progression system with XP rank progression with more prices to unlock. There is multiplayer in the game! But sadly I didn't get a chance to try it, but I bet that it's way more fun than playing with bots. You can select unranked or ranked match, and my blood is definitely boiling to do rank matches with others.

So this is what we can expect for the future of the game, and I bet that we'll see even more if it does good.

Last thoughts

So yeah this is what you get with the game right now. Quite simple, but you know what, that doesn't matter to me. This new sport that we're playing here is super fun and I just like that I can put on my headset and have a squash like experience in my room. Something to keep in mind is that you need a lot of space to set it up. You cannot shrink the arena unfortunately.

With the Mixed Reality experience, this is just an excellent way to bring your headset anywhere and put Spinball to pass some time. I mean, you might look a little weird if you play at an airport or in a mall, but I gave it a try outside, and yeah I just feel like it's an awesome experience to play anywhere.

Something that I want to mention is that the workout aspect of it is kind of moderate to me. I break a little bit of a sweat after 40 minutes, but it's not something that makes me sweat as much as Beat Saber. The moving around with your legs is great though. I did need to do a nice stretch a few times to reach the ball. Also, I don't know if it's because I already felt sick or not, but I did get a little bit of VR sickness while playing this game. It could be because I was spinning around the arena too much in the headset, but I don't know if this would happen to you or not.

Alright guys! If you just got yourself a nice brand new Meta Quest 3S, I think that this is a great game to pickup on the side and experience Mixed Reality with it. It's great for an introduction game since Mixed Reality is usually the best way to ease someone into the headset. So go ahead and give it a try if you want to move a little and experience a fun Sport game only possible through the power of VR."

https://sidequestvr.com/app/37849/guardian-of-realms,"I'm playing the Survival Mode of the game. Your task here is relatively straight-forward. Defend the Sacred Crystal in your environment while battling wave after wave of enemies who are out to attack both the Sacred Crystal and YOU! You will want to heal the crystal between waves by simply grabbing it. This may sound simple, but it is much more difficult that in sounds. 

There is also a Sandbox Mode which allows you to customize components of the game like types of enemies, and difficulty. This is the first Mixed Reality game with MOD support. I didn't even cover the half of what this game offers. There are modifiers you can use in this Sandbox mod, such as weapon mods, gravity and time manipulation, and more to create a battle of your choosing. 

Keep in mind this is the Early Access version. The Full Release has plans for new enemies, maps, and weapons. There is an update expected in October. I look forward to the further development of this title."
https://sidequestvr.com/app/37849/guardian-of-realms,"Guardian of Realms came in early access on September 17th, 2024. But we've actually gotten a new update last week with a lot of new additions that we'll be talking about today. The game is available on Meta Quest 3 and 3S which are perfect for the mixed reality experience. The developers are Sinn Studio who are well known for their game Swordsman VR and are also currently working on an online PvP fighting game. Alright lets dig into the game.

Gameplay / Survival

Today we'll mostly be digging into 3 modes that the game has to offer among other things. The main one is a mode called survival. What you need to do first is place a crystal that you need to defend. You can place it wherever you feel like it's best for you. You are then tasked to heal the crystal to its fullest. As soon as it's fully healed, the game starts and waves of enemies will start spawning. 

You'll get regular human enemies, they can be from just having a sword up also having a shield and a bunch of armor pieces, which makes it harder to hit. They take about 3 hits before they are completely down.

You also get those flying balls from hell that can either spit out a green gew at you or your crystal or go ahead and take a bite out of it when they're close.

You lose when either your crystal is completely drained, or you run out of health. What's nice is that while there's no enemy, you can put both your hands on the crystal and regenerated it a little so you can last longer, and your health does regenerate slowly automatically.

Sandbox

Sandbox is a mode where you can just do whatever you want in the game. It's great if you want to use your imagination and play around with things. You get some nice options in there.

You get to select how many enemies you want to fight with up to 2 human and 5 flying enemies. It gets pretty crazy when you just have a bunch of these balls flying around your head. They feel like flies that you just want to swat with your hand.

And that's a nice thing that you can do here. You have an option called ""Doomfist"". And the higher you slide that bar, the more damage you will do for punching and swatting enemies. So if you feel like brawling them. There's that option.

You can also set the difficulty of the enemies and make them spawn in waves instead of continuously. I didn't touch those options much. I did touch the Invincible Player option though. It's great if you don't want to be disturbed and just play around.

I kept the best 2 options for last guys. You can enable an ability called ""Chronokinesis"". When this is enabled and you press the trigger, you go in a slowmotion mode and it's pretty cool for certain moments of the game. I could see some people doing some pretty cool stuff with it.

Last option is the gravity. Basically you can set the gravity to be none, and all enemies that dies will just fly around in the air as you continue your journey.

Mods

The last big thing that was added recently are the mods. Here you can browse in this section and modify some stuff in the game that was created by the community. For the moment, it looks like there are 3 things that you can mod: Your sword, your shield and the environment outside of your room. For example, it was pretty trippy fighting in a minecraft-like environment with captain america's shield and a sweet katana. But I have to say what I enjoyed the most was when I had a baseball bat, went into sandbox mode with zero gravity and only flying enemies, and I was trying to do homeruns with them haha.

But yeah what's also cool is that you don't need a PC to install these mods. It's all included in the standalone headset and super easy to install and activate with the press of a button.

Last Thoughts

So guys this is what you get from Guardian of Realms! First, I want to say that I find it pretty cool how the game adapts the whichever environment you're in. It'll add doors and windows where it's best suited, and I think that you can get a better experience with the more that you have. I set my outside up in a way that all guardians would come out of my baby barn as you can see it here and it was just silly and fun.

I've also learned that the game has long term support. So as time goes, we'll be seeing some better features out of it. Make sure to join their discord and give you're feedback if you'd like to help shape the game.

Now, I do like my games when there's progression in it. Just know that this one doesn't have any campaign or story. It's mostly just a sandbox, or try to achieve your own personal best score in the survival section. But something to also keep in mind is that the game is only $14.99 Canadian. I think that it's a good entry for anyone who wants to try a mixed reality experience with the new Meta Quest 3S, but there won't be a lot to keep you going for hours. So hopefully the developers can add some kind of progression system in the long run. That's my biggest want."

No thumbstick movement—you’re actually moving your body, ducking and diving around your space, defending a crystal like your life depends on it. It's a great workout!

AND you can add mods directly in the game, no extra hardware needed.

Seeing your Meta avatar in the game adds a personal touch, and there's tons of replay value with customers asking for different drinks each time. It gave me flashbacks to my restaurant days with impatient customers and the occasional thrown drink. The only reason I can’t give it the full 5 stars is based off some issues grabbing drinks in the game. When reaching for a bottle, I would move the rotating shelf and when trying to move the shelf, I would grab a bottle. But I know that can be a quick fix so I hope to give this the full 5 stars soon!

https://sidequestvr.com/app/36859/fracked,"Today we're doing a review of Fracked. The game came out back in 2021, but we've recently got a port of the game on Meta Quest, which is the version that we'll be reviewing today. Since this is my first time playing the game, I'll be talking about every aspect of it, but I'll also be talking on how well it performs as a standalone game since sometimes porting games can be a hit or miss experience. So let's get into it!

The new Meta Quest port of Fracked released on August 29th 2024 and is available for $26.99 Canadian. It is supported on the Quest 2, Pro, and 3. The game original came out on PSVR1 3 years ago, and then a port of the game was made for PCVR a year later. And it was developed by nDreams, a well known developer and publisher who made games such as Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord, Synapse, Little Cities and the upcoming vibrant color PvP shooter, Frenzies. 

Gameplay

Fracked is first and foremost a first person shooter. You'll be progressing through the game while enemies are blocking your way, so you have to eliminate them. You can shoot them multiple times on the body, but a headshot will instantly kill them. Your health will regenerate automatically if you hide and don't get shot for a few seconds. You can drop your magazine if it's not empty yet by pressing B, and you can reload by pushing the magazine back in the gun, and then crank it. A cool thing is that you can check how much bullets are left by looking at the side of the gun, and it'll become transparent so you can see what's inside the clip. 

The nice thing about the game is that you're not often forced to defeat all of the enemies. If you feel daring enough to go to the next objective, you can totally do that at your own risk. But usually it's best to clear out the enemies in the area before you do so.

nDreams has kind of some signature mechanics that they've been using in their games, and they can be seen here. There's many sections where you can zipline your way from one room to another, and there's also the hiding mechanic where you grab the ledge of a hiding spot, and you pull yourself behind it. This mechanic can also be seen in games such as Synapse and the new upcoming Frenzies. It's pretty cool and very useful from time to time when you desperately need to take cover. It's way faster than moving and crouching in real life.

Variety

There are also different elements added to your adventure that keeps the game fresh throughout your playthrough. Something very unique are the skiing sections where you're going down mountains full of snow. You need to lean your head left and right to move around and make sure that you don't hit any obstacles. You will also need to use your gun to shoot enemies that are chasing you on snowmobiles and the ones that are in guard posts. These sections happen once in a while throughout the adventure, but it never felt old. They were really fun.

There are also a lot of climbable sections in the game, with a few little platforming sections. Nothing crazy, but the flow of the game is done really well. Because after fighting off a lot of enemies, these climbable sections just help with taking the time to breath before you travel through another section full of action. 

Story

The story is fun to follow. The protagonist is a special force operative and was skiing in the mountains, but i believe that he then got caught in an avalanche, so he shot a flair gun to get some help. That's when Rosaleen came with her helicopter and follows you through the adventure.

As you and Rosaleen progress, you realize that a group of people are fracking in the mountains, but something weird is happening. The people over there has gone insane and are shooting everyone that they see in sight. You've decided to go investigate and see exactly what's happening and get to the bottom of things.

It's not a crazy story, but like it said, it's a fun one to follow through, it has a good formula to keep it interesting. It almost have that James Bond/Perfect Dark vibe, but with a little bit more action.

Graphics/Design

I love the graphics of the game! They're using a cell shaded style and the colors used really looks good and pops well in VR. The environments just have some nice details and doesn't feel bland at all. Honestly, they really did a good job at porting the game on Meta Quest. I've been using the Quest 3, and the resolution is great. I haven't played the other versions, but this stand-alone one haven't given me any hints that the game's graphics were toned down or anything like that. There's no pop-ins or any graphics detail changes when you get close. It almost feel like the game was built to be on the platform. So for anyone who's worried, I'm pretty confident that you get an equal or better experience on the Quest. 

The level design is also really good. You never really get lost and it's pretty easy to understand what you need to do next. Some nice places to hide during the action sequences, and there are some special weapons put at certain locations which feels rewarding when you find them. There are small puzzles that you have to figure out from time to time, but nothing that breaks the flow of the game.

Music/Sound Design
I actually really liked the soundtrack of the game. You know, when you play a game and you're really into it, but then the music kicks in and you notice it to a point where in your mind you're like ""Wow! This is really good!"" , to me this means that they've done an excellent job with the music, and this is the case here. There are many times in the game where it was really enjoyable. 

And the sound design is also good. They use spacial audio properly and you know exactly where things are. The gun sounds great, and you don't hear enemies saying the same phrase over and over as far as I can tell, which can usually be an annoying thing in games like this. If the sound is not enough to locate enemies, you will also see the enemies shadow through the wall if they make sounds, so you never have too much of a hard time finding them.


Length/Difficulty
One thing I want to say is that the game is a little on the short side. It took me less than 2 hours to complete. But the nice thing is that there are a few things that can extend your time with Fracked, and here they are:

There are 3 types of difficulties. Easy, medium and hard. Medium is the difficulty I've chosen because on hard, you only have one life throughout your adventure. Definitely something that I'd like to revisit and do at some point. I love the sound of that challenge. 

Every time you finish a level, you are present with a score and a rank that you've achieved. I'd love to challenge myself and see if I could achieve an S Rank on every level. You gain score by not dying on the chapter, and killing enemies with only one headshot boosts your score immensely. I think that the time you take also affects the score. 

The last replayability element is that there's some collectable coins that you can find in hidden places in the game. It was fun and satisfying when you went in a spot off track and you found those. I'm not sure if they affect anything in the game though. 

Nitpicks
Just a few nitpicks that I want to mention. Nothing that personally affected my enjoyment of the game, but I just want to lay it out there in case it matters to some of you. 

There are some things that lacks in variety. Outside of the special weapons, you only have 2: the handgun and the SMG, and you end up mostly only using the SMG, unless you run out of bullets. 

There are also not a lot of enemy types. You have the regular mobs shooting at you, suicide bombers, and then the bigger guys that requires a little bit more effort to defeat. And you fight through those 3 types throughout the game. There's a reskin for certain of them, but they pretty much act the same way.

The last thing is that there's not really an aiming sight to your guns. You kind of have to guess where to shoot, especially when they're far away. But you get used to it and it's not much of a big issue.

Outro
Thank you so much for sticking throughout the review with me guys! The summary of Fracked is that I personally really enjoyed it! If you're in the mood for an action first person shooter, you're in for a fun time! Although I would've definitely loved to double my time in this adventure. The ending of the game kind of hinted for a sequel, so hopefully we get to see that in the future. I would love to get back into the shoes of our hero."
https://sidequestvr.com/app/36859/fracked,"While originally released on PSVR1 and then Steam, this game has officially made it's way onto the Quest. It's a fast paced action/adventure shooter that makes you feel like Drake from the Uncharted series. Skiing, swinging, and climbing from place to place while dodging bullets and staying alive this game is heart pounding action every step of the way. My only criticism is that it's not a very long game but aside from that it's absolutely fantastic."
